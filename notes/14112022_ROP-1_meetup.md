# 14/11/2022: ROP-1 meetup

I did a "Review pos_incentives.py" listed in [14/11/2022: ROP-1 meetup](https://efdn.notion.site/14-11-2022-ROP-1-meetup-a12e903e1f7f48d592e964866cd6e62f).  
NOTE that a [PR](https://github.com/CADLabs/ethereum-economic-model/pull/136) has already been issued for the following, so we can say this task has been resolved.
> Merge date must be fixed, correct date and time (can we fix block time?)

## Reward weights?
Investigating about this, I found the followings:
- The reward calculation method was updated to use [Incentivization weights](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/altair/beacon-chain.md#aside-validator-duties-rewards-and-penalties) in the Altair upgrade.
- There are no changes related to rewards in the file beacon-chain.md of the [Bellatrix upgrade](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/bellatrix/beacon-chain.md).
- This reword calculation on the consensus layer has anything to do with the Paris upgrade, which is an upgrade on the execution layer.
- Currently, the Ethereum Economic Model calculates rewards based on Altair. The Merge does not update the reward calculation method, so there is no need to change the Ethereum Economic Model settings for this part.

## MIN_SLASHING_QUOTIENT?
Investigating [pos_incentives.py](https://github.com/CADLabs/ethereum-economic-model/blob/main/model/parts/pos_incentives.py) and [consensus-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs), I found the followings:
- [Bellatrix upgrade](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/bellatrix/beacon-chain.md) does not change the areas related to the calculation of reward, penalty, and slashing except for [penalty parameters](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/bellatrix/beacon-chain.md#updated-penalty-values) such as `MIN_SLASHING_PENALTY_QUOTIENT` and `PROPORTIONAL_SLASHING_MULTIPLIER`. Therefore, it is sufficient to check [Phase0](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md) and [Altair upgrade](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md).
- [Altair upgrade states](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/beacon-chain.md#updated-penalty-values) `MIN_SLASHING_PENALTY_QUOTIENT_ALTAIR` is `2**6 (= 64)`. On the other hand, in Ethereum Economic Model, the value of `MIN_SLASHING_PENALTY_QUOTIENT` in Mathematical_specification.md is `32` and `64` in the other files. I made a [PR](https://github.com/CADLabs/ethereum-economic-model/pull/137) to update the parameter.
