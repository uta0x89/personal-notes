# Dev Update Week 1
This is the week 1 update.

I got interested in the economic aspects of Ethereum and worked on ROP-1.

## Update
### cadCAD Edu
- I found that I need to complete Masterclass of [cadCAD Edu](https://www.cadcad.education/) to work on [ROP-1](https://efdn.notion.site/ROP-1-Ethereum-economic-model-review-53d8410e3fb642c5853424b8f79707ea).
- I have finished Bootcamp and Masterclass of cadCAD Edu.

### ROP-1
- I did a "Review pos_incentives.py" listed in [14/11/2022: ROP-1 meetup](https://efdn.notion.site/14-11-2022-ROP-1-meetup-a12e903e1f7f48d592e964866cd6e62f). Results are [here](./14112022_ROP-1_meetup.md).
- I worked on "Looking at withdrawals" in [ROP-1](https://efdn.notion.site/ROP-1-Ethereum-economic-model-review-53d8410e3fb642c5853424b8f79707ea). Results are [here](./Looking_at_withdrawals.md)

## Planning

- I will consider if the Ethereum Economic Model should be improved to [estimate withdrawal duration](https://twitter.com/AFDudley0/status/1581675060351275008).
- To tackle [tweets on censorship](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot/status/1561194859238531073), I will research the relevant areas.
