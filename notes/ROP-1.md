# ROP-1: Ethereum economic model review

I worked on several issues in [ROP-1](https://efdn.notion.site/ROP-1-Ethereum-economic-model-review-53d8410e3fb642c5853424b8f79707ea).

- [14/11/2022: ROP-1 meetup](./14112022_ROP-1_meetup.md)  
I reviewed the following parameters, which were listed as issues in ROP-1 meetup.
  - Reward weights
  - MIN_SLASHING_QUOTIENT
- [Looking at withdrawals](./Looking_at_withdrawals.md)  
I made [a solution](./exit-duration.ipynb) for [an issue about withdrawals of staked Ethereum](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot/status/1581686737943728129).
- How the network behaves and the dynamics under censorship  
I would like to work on [this issue](https://twitter.com/barnabemonnot/status/1561194859238531073) in the future.
